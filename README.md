# Clickbait-Identification
In this project we have compared the properties of Clickbait titles vs Non-Clickbait titles. <Write about classifiers>
The project is done in Hindi. Created for the course project of the Spring '21 Course - Computational Linguistics -1.

## Tasks
1. Preprocess the dataset
2. Analysis on the basis of
  1. Number of tokens
  2. Presence of Question mark
  3. Presence of Exclaimation mark
  4. Presence of quotations
  5. Number of stopwords
  6. Presence of numerals
  7. the entities present
  8. POS tags

3. Plotting graphs of all these analysis.
4. Making word clouds for the different name entities present.
5. Comparing the list of entities present in Clickbait vs Non-Clickbait
  

In Clickbait.ipynb all the above analysis have been made for Clickbait titles vs Non-Clickbait. 
Classifier.ipynb contains .............

## Tools used
We have used `pandas` to analyse data, `re` to clean the data,`NLTK` to tokenize, a custom stopword file - stopword.txt to identify stopwords,`polyglot` library for NER, `wordcloud` python package and `mathplotlib.pyplot` to make wordclouds,`stanza` to POS tag, ____ to make the analysis graphs.
